# Lending Club Loans Data Analysis

## Business Problem 1

### Background
Lending Club is a peer-to-peer lending platform where members can lend and borrow money. The platform provides anonymized data on loans and borrowers, which can be used for analysis.

### Business Problem
Using Lending Club loans data, the team aims to test the following hypotheses to understand the relationships between various factors:

1. **Interest rate variation with loan amount**: Higher loan amounts are charged lower interest rates.
2. **Loan length impact on interest rate**: Loan length directly affects the interest rate.
3. **Interest rate differences based on loan purpose**: Interest rates vary depending on the purpose of the loan.
4. **Relationship between FICO scores and home ownership**: Individuals who own homes tend to have higher FICO scores.

## Analysis Plan
To validate the hypotheses, the following statistical methods will be used:
- **Hypothesis testing** (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) to determine relationships between interest rates, loan amounts, loan purposes, and loan lengths.
- **Correlation analysis** to explore the relationship between FICO scores and home ownership.
- **Data visualization** to identify trends and patterns in the dataset.

3. Apply statistical tests and visualize results to draw insights.
4. Validate the hypotheses and summarize findings.
